## OpenCV + GoPro HERO4

This is an experiment to detect faces using a GoPro HERO4 and OpenCV on Python. Ultimately we want to detect fishes. This has a wide range of applications, from self driving small cars to research and investigation.

Tested with a GoPro HERO4 Black and a computer running Linux. Probably does not work on Windows.

Needs FFmpeg and OpenCV-Python installed.

Open ```gopro_keepalive.py``` in one terminal and ```gopro_opencv.py``` in a separate terminal.
